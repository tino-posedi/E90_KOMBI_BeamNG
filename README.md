# BMW E90 instrument cluster CAN-Bus project

The BMW E90 instrument cluster project aims to interface and control the instrument cluster from a BMW E90 using a CAN-Bus Shield and an Arduino Uno. This project enables the gathering of information from the BeamNG.drive simulator and replicating the functionality on the physical instrument cluster.

## The idea behind this project
Modern vehicles utilize CAN (Controller Area Network) bus communication to interconnect various electronic control units (ECUs) within the vehicle. The BMW E90 instrument cluster project focuses on interfacing with the instrument cluster of a BMW E90 using a CAN-Bus Shield and an Arduino Uno. By interfacing the cluster with the Arduino and simulating CAN messages, the project aims to display data obtained from the BeamNG.drive simulator on the actual instrument cluster.

## Components
**To get started with this project, you will need the following components:**

- Arduino Uno
- CAN-Bus Shield (Seeed Studio or compatible)
