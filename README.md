# BMW E90 instrument cluster project

Utilizing the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus system, which is a prevalent communication protocol in modern vehicles, this project involves decoding and interpreting the data exchanged between the BMW E90's instrument cluster and other vehicle components. By tapping into this network, the project unlocks access to a treasure trove of real-time information, including speed, RPM, fuel level, temperature, and various warning lights.

The ultimate goal of this project is to harness the power of the CAN bus data and integrate it into BeamNG, a highly advanced and realistic driving simulation game. This integration allows players to experience the thrill of driving a BMW E90 virtually while having accurate and dynamic feedback from the instrument cluster. Imagine revving the engine, shifting gears, and seeing the dashboard respond just like in a real car.

# Key Features:

Real-time Data Integration: The project aims to capture and interpret data from the BMW E90's CAN bus in real time, ensuring that in-game feedback mirrors real-world vehicle behavior.

Immersive Gameplay: Players will be able to experience an unprecedented level of immersion by interacting with a virtual BMW E90 that responds accurately to their actions, just like the real car would.

Authentic Dashboard Interaction: The project seeks to replicate the BMW E90's instrument cluster behavior within the game, including functioning speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, and warning lights.

Customization: Enthusiasts will have the opportunity to customize their virtual driving experience, experimenting with different vehicle settings and configurations.

Educational Value: This project also offers a unique learning opportunity for those interested in automotive technology, CAN bus communication, and software-hardware integration.

By merging the worlds of real-world automotive engineering and virtual simulation, the BMW E90 CAN Bus Communication for BeamNG integration project pushes the boundaries of virtual driving experiences. It offers an exciting glimpse into the future of gaming, where technology allows us to blur the lines between reality and virtual worlds. Whether you're a car enthusiast, a gamer, or a curious tinkerer, this project is bound to captivate your imagination and open new avenues of exploration. Join us in this journey of innovation and excitement as we bring the BMW E90 to life within the digital realm like never before.
